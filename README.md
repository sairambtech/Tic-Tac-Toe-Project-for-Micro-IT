# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project-for-Micro-IT
This C++ program is a two-player console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players take turns choosing positions on a 3x3 board by entering numbers 1â€“9. The game checks for a win or draw after each move and announces the result. It includes input validation and a simple interface for interactive play.
